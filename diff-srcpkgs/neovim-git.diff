+#
+# You can use your existing ~/.vimrc, files, and plugins located within ~/.vim without having to symlink the files.
+#
+# And this is now documented in NeoVim manual, see Transitioning from Vim.
+#
+# For Linux and macOS, just add below lines to the top of your ~/.config/nvim/init.vim, or %LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim\init.vim for Windows.
+#
+# set runtimepath^=~/.vim runtimepath+=~/.vim/after
+# let &packpath=&runtimepath
+# source ~/.vimrc
+#
+# The above lines will add the existing paths and ~/.vimrc file to your nvim setup.
